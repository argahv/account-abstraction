## 🔐 Feature 1: Delegation System

### Purpose

Allows account owners to delegate specific permissions to other addresses without giving full control.

### Key Components

- **Allowed Selectors**: Specific function signatures delegates can call
- **Expiry Time**: Time-based access control
- **Granular Permissions**: Fine-grained control over what delegates can do

### Implementation

```solidity
struct Delegation {
    address delegate;
    bytes4[] allowedSelectors;
    uint256 expiry;
    bool active;
}
```

### Use Cases

- **Corporate Accounts**: Employees can execute specific functions
- **DAO Governance**: Delegates can vote on specific proposal types
- **Service Providers**: Limited access to perform specific operations

### Demo Results

✅ **Delegate**: `0x3C44...93BC`  
✅ **Allowed Functions**: `transfer()`, `approve()`  
✅ **Expiry**: 1 hour from grant time  
✅ **Test**: Successfully transferred 100 tokens via delegation

## 🔑 Feature 2: Session Keys

### Purpose

Temporary keys with spending limits for secure, time-limited access patterns.

### Key Components

- **Spending Limits**: Maximum value the session key can spend
- **Expiry Time**: Automatic revocation after time limit
- **Function Restrictions**: Limited to specific function calls
- **Usage Tracking**: Monitors spent amounts

### Implementation

```solidity
struct SessionKey {
    address keyAddress;
    uint256 expiry;
    uint256 spendingLimit;
    uint256 spentAmount;
    bool active;
    bytes4[] allowedSelectors;
}
```

### Use Cases

- **Mobile Wallets**: Temporary access for specific transactions
- **Gaming**: Limited spending for in-game purchases
- **DeFi Protocols**: Automated trading with limits
- **Subscription Services**: Recurring payments with caps

### Demo Results

✅ **Session Key**: `0x90F7...3b906`  
✅ **Spending Limit**: 500 tokens  
✅ **Expiry**: 2 hours from creation  
✅ **Test**: Successfully transferred 200 tokens within limit

## 🔒 Feature 3: Multi-Signature System

### Purpose

Requires multiple approvals for UserOperations, enhancing security for high-value accounts.

### Key Components

- **Signer Management**: Configurable list of authorized signers
- **Threshold Control**: M-of-N approval requirements
- **UserOperation Approval**: Pre-approval system for operations
- **Validation Integration**: Seamless integration with ERC-4337 validation

### Implementation

```solidity
struct MultiSigConfig {
    address[] signers;
    uint256 threshold;
    bool active;
}
```

### Use Cases

- **Corporate Treasury**: Multiple executives must approve large transfers
- **DAO Multi-sig**: Board members approve governance actions
- **Family Accounts**: Parents approve children's spending
- **Investment Funds**: Multiple fund managers approve trades

### Demo Results

✅ **Signers**: 3 addresses configured  
✅ **Threshold**: 2-of-3 approval required  
✅ **Test**: Successfully obtained 2 approvals for UserOperation

## 👥 Feature 4: Social Recovery

### Purpose

Guardian-based account recovery system for lost private keys or compromised accounts.

### Key Components

- **Guardian Management**: Trusted addresses that can initiate recovery
- **Recovery Threshold**: Minimum guardians needed for recovery
- **Time Delay**: Security delay before recovery execution
- **Recovery Requests**: Structured recovery process

### Implementation

```solidity
struct RecoveryRequest {
    address newOwner;
    uint256 timestamp;
    uint256 approvals;
    bool executed;
    mapping(address => bool) hasApproved;
}
```

### Security Features

- **2-day delay** before recovery execution
- **Guardian consensus** required
- **Transparent process** with event logging
- **Owner notification** through events

### Use Cases

- **Personal Wallets**: Family/friends as guardians
- **Corporate Accounts**: Board members as guardians
- **DAO Accounts**: Community leaders as guardians
- **Inheritance**: Beneficiaries as guardians

### Demo Results

✅ **Guardians**: 3 guardians configured  
✅ **Recovery Threshold**: 2-of-3 guardian approval  
✅ **Test**: Successfully initiated and approved recovery request  
✅ **Security**: 2-day delay enforced before execution

## 💰 Feature 5: Daily Spending Limits

### Purpose

Automatic spending caps to prevent unauthorized or excessive transactions.

### Key Components

- **Token-Specific Limits**: Different limits for different tokens
- **Daily Reset**: Limits reset every 24 hours
- **Automatic Enforcement**: Built into execution logic
- **Configurable Limits**: Owner can adjust limits

### Implementation

```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) public dailySpendingLimits; // token => limit
mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => uint256)) public dailySpent; // token => day => amount
```

### Security Benefits

- **Damage Limitation**: Caps potential losses from compromised keys
- **Behavioral Monitoring**: Unusual spending patterns detection
- **Gradual Exposure**: Limits exposure to smart contract risks
- **Compliance**: Regulatory compliance for spending limits

### Use Cases

- **Personal Security**: Daily spending caps for safety
- **Corporate Compliance**: Regulatory spending limits
- **Parental Controls**: Children's spending allowances
- **Risk Management**: Limiting exposure to DeFi protocols

### Demo Results

✅ **Daily Limit**: 1,000 tokens per day  
✅ **Token**: RahatToken configured  
✅ **Enforcement**: Automatic checking during transfers

## ⚡ Feature 6: Batch Operations

### Purpose

Execute multiple operations in a single transaction for gas efficiency and atomic execution.

### Key Components

- **Atomic Execution**: All operations succeed or all fail
- **Gas Efficiency**: Reduced transaction costs
- **Array Processing**: Multiple destinations, values, and calldata
- **Access Control**: Same authorization as individual operations

### Implementation

```solidity
function batchExecute(
    address[] calldata dests,
    uint256[] calldata values,
    bytes[] calldata funcs
) external onlyOwnerOrEntryPoint
```

### Benefits

- **Cost Savings**: Reduced gas costs vs. multiple transactions
- **Atomicity**: Ensures all operations complete together
- **Efficiency**: Single UserOperation for multiple actions
- **Simplicity**: Easier UX for complex workflows

### Use Cases

- **DeFi Strategies**: Multi-step yield farming in one transaction
- **Portfolio Management**: Rebalancing multiple positions
- **Bulk Payments**: Paying multiple recipients at once
- **Complex Workflows**: Multi-step business processes

### Demo Results

✅ **Batch Size**: 2 operations executed  
✅ **Operations**: Transfer to 2 different guardians  
✅ **Atomicity**: Both transfers completed successfully  
✅ **Gas Efficiency**: Single transaction for multiple operations
